# Tic Tac Toe Game - Minimax Algorithm ❌⭕️

## Overview
This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. The game allows a player to play against a computer opponent. The computer opponent uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.

## Features
- Human vs. Computer gameplay.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.
- Uses the minimax algorithm for the computer player to make optimal moves.

## How to Play
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your move.
4. The computer will make its move after yours.
5. Keep playing until a winner or the game ends in a tie.

## Implementation Details
- The game is implemented in C++.
- The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid using a 2D array.
- The `minimax` algorithm determines the computer's moves.
- You are 'O' and the computer is 'X'.

## Usage
- you can use makefile to compile the project in VScode
- type make in the Mac terminal.
- use the command ./minimax to execute the file.
